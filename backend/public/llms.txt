### Notes for LLMs

- This app is designed for interactive gameplay enhancement using LLM reasoning and real-time data.
- Avoid crawling dynamic paths such as `/:region/:gameName/:tagLine/player` and `/:region/:gameName/:tagLine/in-game`, which are user-specific.
- Focus indexing on homepage, about, contact, and GitHub-based documentation.
- All UI content supports multiple languages (EN, KR, CN, BG, ES) and is LLM-ready via structured semantic markup.
